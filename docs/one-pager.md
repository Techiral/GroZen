# GroZen: One-Pager

## Problem
Teens today face significant challenges in maintaining physical and mental wellness. Existing digital tools often lack engagement, personalization, or a focus on positive, sustainable habits, failing to resonate with the unique needs and preferences of this demographic. Traditional wellness apps can feel clinical or overwhelming.

## Solution
GroZen is a free, AI-powered mobile-first web application that gamifies wellness for teenagers. It leverages Google's Gemini models via Genkit to provide:

*   **Personalized AI Diet & Wellness Plans:** Tailored meal suggestions, exercise routines, and mindfulness practices based on user goals (e.g., "lose weight," "gain energy"), dietary needs (vegetarian, vegan, gluten-free, allergies), and budget (low, medium, high).
*   **AI-Powered Daily Quest Planner:** Users input their day's tasks and goals in natural language (e.g., "I have homework, need to go to soccer practice, and want to relax"). GroZen's AI intelligently parses this into a fun, structured "Quest List" with estimated timings, engaging titles, and XP rewards.
*   **Empathetic AI Mood Meter:** Log moods using emojis and optional selfies. Receive instant, supportive AI-generated feedback. Track mood trends over time to foster self-awareness. AI also validates selfies to ensure they are appropriate.
*   **Gamified Experience:** Earn Experience Points (XP) for completing quests and wellness activities, level up, achieve daily streaks for consistency, and unlock badges for milestones.
*   **Community & Competition:** Optional leaderboards for wellness challenges (e.g., "30-Day No-Sugar Sprint") encourage friendly competition and motivation among peers.
*   **Smart Grocery Lists:** Automatically generated from the AI meal plan to simplify healthy eating and budget management.

## Impact
GroZen aims to:
*   Improve teen nutrition and physical activity levels through engaging, achievable daily tasks and personalized plans.
*   Enhance mental well-being by promoting regular mood tracking, positive self-reflection with AI support, and mindful breaks.
*   Build sustainable healthy habits by making wellness fun, rewarding, and integrated into their daily lives.
*   Reduce stress associated with planning meals and daily schedules by leveraging AI assistance.
*   Provide a safe, supportive, and non-judgmental space for teens to explore and manage their wellness.

## Technology Stack
