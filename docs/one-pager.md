# GroZen: One-Pager 🌟

## Problem 😓
I’m a teen, and life’s crazy- school, friends, and stress make it tough to eat healthy or stay chill. Most wellness apps are boring, confusing, or feel like they’re for adults. They don’t vibe with me or make building habits fun. I need a tool that fits my hectic life and feels like a game, not a chore.

## Solution 🎮
