## Why GroZen? 🌟
As a student, I often have trouble focusing because my attention span is short. I wanted one place to track my mood, thoughts, plans, and productivity instead of using different apps for to-do lists, well-being, and budgeting. This need for simplicity and organization led to the creation of Grozen.

## What It Does 🥗😊🏆
- **Mood Tracking:** You can easily keep track of how you’re feeling and see how your mood changes over time with a simple graph.
- **Task Management:** The app allows you to use everyday language to create to-do lists, making it easy to organize your tasks without any issue.
- **Personalized Plans:** It offers a gamified interactive setup process that leads to customized meal, workout, and mental wellness plans just for you.
- **Fun Competitions:** You can join in on challenges and compete with other users for added motivation.
- **Grocery List Creation:** Based on your meal plans, GroZen can automatically create a grocery list, so you know exactly what to buy.
- **Engaging Experience:** The app is designed to be fun and easy to use, with a clean look and lots of customization options to make it your own.

## Why It’s Perfect for StartWell 🌍
- **AI Innovation**: Uses **Genkit (Google Gemini)** for diet plans, daily schedules, mood feedback, and selfie validation, hitting StartWell’s AI focus.
- **Teen Appeal**: Vibrant, neumorphic UI with gamified “quests” and badges keeps teens engaged.
- **Wellness Impact**: Boosts nutrition, mental health, and habits for teens.
- **User-Friendly**: Simple onboarding and clear visuals make it accessible to all.
- **Scalable**: Built on Firebase for growth; future plans include group challenges and wearables.

## Tech Stack 🛠️
- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ShadCN UI (neumorphic dark theme).
- **AI**: Genkit with Google Gemini for plan generation, scheduling, and mood analysis.
- **Backend**: Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Functions).
- **Hosting**: Firebase Hosting or Vercel.
