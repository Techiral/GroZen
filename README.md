**Free AI Wellness Quest for Teens: Personalized Plans, Mood Boosts & Fun Challenges!**

GroZen is a free, AI-powered wellness app designed specifically for teens. We're turning self-care into an epic adventure with personalized health missions, instant mood feedback, and friendly competition.

## The Problem We're Solving
Many teens struggle to find engaging, accessible, and non-judgmental tools to manage their physical and mental well-being. Generic advice often misses the mark, and traditional wellness apps can feel clinical or overwhelming. There's a clear need for a wellness solution that speaks their language and fits their lifestyle.

    *   Fill in your Firebase project configuration details in `.env.local`. You can get these from your Firebase project settings.
    *   If you're running Genkit locally and not using Firebase Extensions for billing/API key management, ensure your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` is set in your environment or `.env` file for Genkit to access Google AI Studio models.
4.  **Run the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```
    The app will be available at `http://localhost:9002` (or your configured port).

5.  **(Optional) Run Genkit Developer UI (for testing flows):**
    In a separate terminal:
    ```bash
    npm run genkit:dev
    ```
    This will typically start the Genkit Developer UI on `http://localhost:4000`.

*   **AI Interactions:** Our AI is designed to be supportive, positive, and non-judgmental. We actively monitor and refine prompts to ensure ethical and helpful responses.
*   **Selfie Data:** Selfie uploads for mood logging are optional. If used for AI face validation, this is clearly communicated, and images are processed to confirm human presence without storing identifiable facial recognition data long-term unless explicitly stated for features like progress tracking (with consent).
