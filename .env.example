# Google AI API Key for Genkit
# This key is used by Genkit to call Google AI models (e.g., Gemini).
# Obtain this from Google AI Studio: https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey
# IMPORTANT: For security, this key should ideally NOT be prefixed with NEXT_PUBLIC_
# if it's only used server-side by Genkit flows. Genkit typically reads GOOGLE_API_KEY
# directly from the environment. If your Genkit setup requires it to be available
# client-side (less common and not recommended for production), then prefix it.
# For most local development and server-side Genkit usage, set:
GOOGLE_API_KEY=YOUR_GOOGLE_AI_STUDIO_API_KEY_HERE
